**[Detect and respond to evolving attacks with Attacker Clustering](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/attacker-clustering/)**  
*Published on Datadog Blog - February 26, 2025*  
*Co-authored with Océane Bordeau*

This article introduces Datadog's new Attacker Clustering feature in App and API Protection (AAP), which helps security teams detect and respond to distributed attacks. The piece explores how the clustering mechanism groups attacker behaviors by analyzing patterns in attributes like user agents and attacker fingerprints, enabling security teams to track evolving attack strategies and streamline incident response.

Key topics covered:
- Advanced threat detection through behavioral clustering
- Adapting to evolving attacker strategies  
- Streamlined incident response workflows
- Pattern recognition for distributed attacks
