Six years ago, I was the junior engineer asking a million questions and trying to figure out why my code worked locally but not in production. Today, I'm a tech lead, and some of my proudest moments aren't shipping features—they're watching engineers I've mentored become better engineers themselves.

The transition from individual contributor to tech lead isn't just about writing better code. It's about learning an entirely different skill: helping others write better code. Here's what I wish I'd known about mentoring engineers, and what surprised me along the way.

## The Mindset Shift: From "How Do I?" to "How Do They?"

When I became a tech lead, my biggest challenge wasn't technical—it was psychological. I went from optimizing my own learning to optimizing someone else's.

**The old me:** "How can I understand this codebase faster?"
**The new me:** "How can I help X understand this codebase in a way that builds her confidence?"

This shift is harder than it sounds. Your instinct is to just fix the problem or give the answer. But good mentoring means resisting that urge and asking better questions instead.

### What I Try To Do Now:
- Instead of saying "This is wrong," I ask "What do you think might happen if we deploy this?"
- Instead of debugging their code, I sit with them and ask "Where should we look first?"
- Instead of assigning tasks, I ask "What would you like to work on next?"

## The Types of Engineers I've Learned to Mentor

Every engineer is different, but I've noticed patterns in how people learn and what they need from mentorship.

### 1. The Overthinker
These engineers know their stuff but second-guess everything. They'll spend three days perfecting a solution that needed to ship yesterday.

**What they need:** Permission to ship imperfect code and iterate.

**What works:** Setting explicit "good enough" criteria upfront. "This needs to handle the happy path and basic error cases. We can add edge case handling in v2."

### 2. The Rusher
They move fast but sometimes miss important details like performance considerations or edge cases.

**What they need:** Structure and checklists, not judgment.

**What works:** Production shipping checklists and pair programming sessions where we walk through scenarios together.

## My Biggest Mentoring Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Assuming Everyone Learns Like I Do
I'm a "figure it out by breaking things" learner. I assumed everyone was. Turns out some people need more structure, clearer documentation, or pair programming to feel confident.

**The fix:** I now ask new team members: "How do you learn best?" and "What kind of support helps you the most?"

### Mistake #2: Solving Problems Instead of Teaching Problem-Solving
Early on, I'd jump in and fix issues to "save time." This created dependencies instead of building skills.

**The fix:** I bite my tongue and ask "What's your hypothesis?" even when I know the answer. The extra 20 minutes now saves hours later.

### Mistake #3: Not Celebrating Small Wins
I focused on big milestones and missed the daily victories. This can make junior engineers feel like they weren't progressing.

**The fix:** I now explicitly call out improvements: "Your perfomance assessment for this feature is so much thorough than last month" or "I love how you thought about the user experience here."

## What Mentoring Taught Me About Leadership

The weird thing about mentoring is that it made me a better engineer, not just a better leader.

### I Became a Better Communicator
When you have to explain complex product concepts to someone new, you realize which parts of your knowledge are actually assumptions. I now try to document things I used to keep in my head.

### I Learned to Ask Better Questions
Good mentoring questions work for technical discussions too:
- "What assumptions are we making?"
- "What would have to be true for this to work?"
- "What's the simplest version of this we could ship?"

### I Got Better at Prioritization
When you're responsible for someone else's growth, you become ruthless about what actually matters. Not every code review comment is worth discussing. Not every technical debt needs fixing right now.

## The Moments That Made It Worth It

**The Confident Speaker:** A junior engineer who barely spoke in meetings is now presenting architecture decisions to the rest of the team. The technical growth was obvious, but watching her find her voice was even better.

**The Teacher:** My favorite moment was overhearing an engineer I'd mentored explaining microservices architecture to someone newer. She gained confidence and added her own insight and experience to her explenations.

## Practical Tips for New Mentors

If you're just starting to mentor engineers, here's what I'd focus on:

### 1. Schedule Regular 1:1s
Not just when there are problems. I do 30 minutes weekly to talk about anything: technical questions, career goals, or just how things are going.

### 2. Give Context, Not Just Tasks
Instead of "Fix this bug," try "This bug is affecting our biggest customer, here's the context, how would you approach investigating it?"

### 3. Share Your Own Learning Process
When they're stuck, I often say "When I encounter this kind of problem, I usually start by..." It demystifies problem-solving.

### 4. Be Honest About What You Don't Know
"I'm not sure, let's figure it out together" is often more helpful than pretending to know everything.

### 5. Connect Them to Other People
Sometimes they need a different perspective or expertise I don't have. I'm always introducing engineers to other team members who can help with specific questions.

## The Long Game

The best part about mentoring isn't the immediate impact—it's the ripple effect. Engineers you mentor go on to mentor others. The culture of learning and growth spreads.
